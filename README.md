# Palindrome Number Math Challenge
A Fun Math Challenge's Algorithm. 

## So What is a palindrome number?
>> For ex: 7117 is a palindrome number which is read the same way from right and left.

# Theory:
### Each *POSITIVE* number that has been summed with its reverse will make a palindrome after a few steps.

<strong>```A Simple Ex: 45 + 54 = 99```</strong>
```139 + 931 = 1070; => 1070 + 0701 = 1771 âœ…```

### Note:
```Some numbers has gone millions of steps but this action has never happened for them. Like 196 or 295.```
